**Tropical Cyclone Risk Analysis [TCRA]**
is a Python package designed to perform
tropical cylone risk simulations. The software includes capability to:

* Scenario Hazard Analysis Based on Historical or Simulated Cyclone Tracks
* Structural Vulnerability Analysis Based on Fragility Curves
* Structural Damage Ratio Estimation
* Loss Estimation from Damage Analysis
* Recovery Simulation
* Social Impact Analysis
* Rehabilitation Scenario Analysis
* Perform Monte Carlo Simulation to account for Uncertainties
* Visualize Results
* Interactive Plots on OpenStreetMap
