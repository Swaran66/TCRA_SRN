TSNet is a Python package designed to perform transient simulation in water
distribution networks. 


** Tropical Cyclone Risk Analysis [TCRA]** is a Python package designed to perform
tropical cylone risk simulations. The software includes capability to:

that allows for the development of scenario-based tropical cyclone risk analysis of buildings and Electrical Power Network (EPN). This tool performs , , damage ratio analysis, loss estimation, recovery simulation of damaged structures, and social impact assessments on the community. It also enables decision-makers to make rehabilitation decisions and perform rehabilitation scenario analysis.

* Scenario Hazard Analysis Based on Historical or Simulated Cyclone Tracks
* Structural Vulnerability Analysis Based on Fragility Curves
* Structural Damage Ratio Estimation
* Loss Estimation
* Recovery Simulation
* Social Impact Analysis
* Rehabilitation Scenario Analysis
* Perform Monte Carlo Simulation to account for Uncertainties
* Visualize results
